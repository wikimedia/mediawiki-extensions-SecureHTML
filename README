Lets you include arbitrary HTML in an authorized and secure way
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Secure_HTML

Occasionally you need to display HTML within a wiki, but allowing it 
site-wide opens you up to various XSS attacks. This extension solves 
that problem by letting you specify arbitrary HTML, but only if the HTML 
includes a corresponding hash that is created by combining the HTML 
input, along with a secret that only authorized people know.

The extension uses a special page, Special:SecureHTML which helps you 
build a tag, <shtml>, which acts as a wrapper around raw HTML.
